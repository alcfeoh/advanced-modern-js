# Exercise 9

## Objectives
* Print the first three people
* Re-order the array
* Sort the array by last name

## Instructions

### Print the first three people

Yes, do that. Print the first three people in the `people` array.

### Re-order the array

Take the first five people in `people` and swap them with the last five. Think of 
a loaf of bread that you cut in half and then put end-to-end.

### Sort the array by last name

Call `sort` on `people` and pass it a custom function which will sort on the 
`lastName` property of each person.
