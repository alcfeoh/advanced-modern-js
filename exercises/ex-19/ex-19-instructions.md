# Exercise 19

## Objectives
* Use multiple promises
* Practice with asynchronous code

## Instructions
In this exercise, weâ€™re going to create promises to simulate a dice game

Your mission: Start from `index.html` and add a new function that generates a random wait time between 0 and 500 milliseconds: 
`randomWait()`

Then create three different promises that use `randomWait` to wait for some time before calling `rollDice()`

Display the value from each dice roll in the console as soon as it is available. 

For instance:
Dice 1 = 6  --- Dice 3 = 4 --- Dice 2 = 3
