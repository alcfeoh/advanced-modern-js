# Exercise 19

## Objectives
* Change the way we retrieve a list of people
* Persist new Person objects to `localStorage`
* Add functionality to clear local storage

## Instructions
Notice that the code from `index.html` has moved into `main.js`.

## Goal
In this lab, weâ€™re going to create promises to simulate a dice game

Your mission: Start from the file es6/dice.js and add a new function that generates a random wait time between 0 and 500 milliseconds: 
randomWait();
Then create three different promises that use randomWait to wait for some time before calling rollDice()
Display the value from each dice roll in the console as soon as it is available. For instance:
Dice 1 = 6  --- Dice 3 = 4 --- Dice 2 = 3
