# Exercise 8

## Objectives
* Use two different array iteration tools
* Filter an array based on criteria
* Map one array to another

## Instructions

### Use two different array iteration tools
Look in `people.js` at the `people` array. This is the data we will be working
with over the next few exercises.

Your work is in `main.js`. Iterate over `people` with a `for-of` loop. Print out
each person with `logger.personLog`.

Iterate over `people` again, this time, using the `forEach()` functional iterator.
Print out each person with `logger.personLog`.

### Filter an array based on criteria
Filter `people` to find only the women in the array. Print them out with 
`logger.personlog`.

### Map one array to another
Use the `map` function to create an array of just the first and last names of 
each person. Print them out using `logger.log`.
